    """Returns a function that returns the weight of an edge.

    The returned function is specifically suitable for input to
    functions :func:`_dijkstra` and :func:`_bellman_ford_relaxation`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph.

    weight : string or function
        If it is callable, `weight` itself is returned. If it is a string,
        it is assumed to be the name of the edge attribute that represents
        the weight of an edge. In that case, a function is returned that
        gets the edge weight according to the specified edge attribute.

    Returns
    -------
    function
        This function returns a callable that accepts exactly three inputs:
        a node, an node adjacent to the first one, and the edge attribute
        dictionary for the eedge joining those nodes. That function returns
        a number representing the weight of an edge.

    If `G` is a multigraph, and `weight` is not callable, the
    minimum edge weight over all parallel edges is returned. If any edge
    does not have an attribute with key `weight`, it is assumed to
    have weight one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    sources : non-empty iterable of nodes
        Starting nodes for paths. If this is just an iterable containing
        a single node, then all paths computed by this function will
        start from that node. If there are two or more nodes in this
        iterable, the computed paths may begin from any one of the start
        nodes.

    weight: function
        Function with (u, v, data) input that returns that edge's weight
        or None to indicate a hidden edge

    pred: dict of lists, optional(default=None)
        dict to store a list of predecessors keyed by that node
        If None, predecessors are not stored.

    paths: dict, optional (default=None)
        dict to store the path list from source to each node, keyed by node.
        If None, paths are not stored.

    target : node label, optional
        Ending node for path. Search is halted when target is found.

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
        Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.
        If cutoff is provided, only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : dictionary
        A mapping from node to shortest distance to that node from one
        of the source nodes.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If any of `sources` is not in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    The optional predecessor and path dictionaries can be accessed by
    the caller through the original pred and paths objects passed
    as arguments. No need to explicitly return pred or paths.

def multi_source_multi_targets_dijkstra(G, sources, targets, cutoff=None, weight="weight"):
    """Find shortest weighted paths and lengths from a given set of
    source nodes.

    Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths and lengths
    between one of the source nodes and the given `target`, or all other
    reachable nodes if not specified, for a weighted graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    sources : non-empty set of nodes
        Starting nodes for paths. If this is just a set containing a
        single node, then all paths computed by this function will start
        from that node. If there are two or more nodes in the set, the
        computed paths may begin from any one of the start nodes.

    target : node label, optional
        Ending node for path

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
        Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.
        If cutoff is provided, only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.

    Returns
    -------
    distance, path : pair of dictionaries, or numeric and list
        If target is None, returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
        The first dictionary stores distance from one of the source nodes.
        The second stores the path from one of the sources to that node.
        If target is not None, returns a tuple of (distance, path) where
        distance is the distance from source to target and path is a list
        representing the path from source to target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> length, path = nx.multi_source_dijkstra(G, {0, 4})
    >>> for node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    ...     print(f"{node}: {length[node]}")
    0: 0
    1: 1
    2: 2
    3: 1
    4: 0
    >>> path[1]
    [0, 1]
    >>> path[3]
    [4, 3]

    >>> length, path = nx.multi_source_dijkstra(G, {0, 4}, 1)
    >>> length
    1
    >>> path
    [0, 1]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    Based on the Python cookbook recipe (119466) at
    https://code.activestate.com/recipes/119466/

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `sources` is empty.
    NodeNotFound
        If any of `sources` is not in `G`.
